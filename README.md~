# FracCalc

Written By Ryan Chan, for CDM AP Computer Science 2015/2016

This program is a fraction calculator. Input must be formatted correctly. Example:

		3_1/2 + 1/2 + 4

Is equivelant to 3.5 + 0.5 + 4, and will produce a result of 8.

There is no limit on the number of fractions that can be entered in a single statement. When more than 2 terms are entered in a single statement, they will be solved using standard order of operations.

Feel free to examine my code and take inspiration from it, but if you copy/paste it directly and get me in trouble, I will hunt you down and destroy your computer with a sledgehammer.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my code.
